Many students find it helpful to refer to this general guide to analysis when conducting a dramatic analysis of a script. ({{% resource_link e15d2fee-0140-be5c-942e-99c0445292b8 "PDF" %}})

One Page Papers
---------------

Whether you act, direct or design, you have to know what a play is most basically about. These one page papers foster that skill.

Students will write papers of not more than one page on _A Doll's House_, _Hedda Gabler_, _The Substance of Fire_, _Copenhagen_, and _Joe Turner's Come and Gone_.

Directions for the One Page Papers ({{% resource_link adf29aaf-fdfb-b5e6-112f-953da0461b21 "PDF" %}})

Three-to-Four Page Papers
-------------------------

### Doll's House Paper

A three-to-four page paper comparing the play and Joseph Losey's film of _A Doll's House_ will be required. This paper must be rewritten and resubmitted after consultation with the instructor. Any or all of the other paper may also be re-written and resubmitted.

### Comparison of Greek and French Plays (_Medea_)

Although Euripides and Anouilh's versions of _Medea_ share the same basic story, and even to some degree the same narrative and dramatic structure, there are significant diferences between them. Those differences are the subject of your essay.

History of Private Life Presentation

Final Presentation and Paper
----------------------------

Students will also complete a project analysing a play chosen from a short list of plays by authors we have already studied in this course: _The Piano Lesson_ by August Wilson, _The Good Person of Szechwan_ by Bertolt Brecht, and _Democracy_ by Michael Frayn. Results of the analysis are to be presented orally to the class, and a summary paper, of at least ten pages and based on the analysis and research, is to be handed in later. The paper should take into account reactions to the oral presentation from students in the class and the instructor. The topic for the presentation/paper is the answer to these questions: What does the play mean? How does it mean it? In addition to answering these questions, the paper should also include some discussion of the consequences for production of the analysis, from the perspective of actor, director or designer, according to the student's particular interests.

Comprehensive Summary Paper
---------------------------

Finally, students write a paper of about three pages, due at the end of the course, that summarizes what each student has learned about reading a script and describes a methodology the student has developed, based on the experience of the course, for reading scripts theatrically and accurately.
